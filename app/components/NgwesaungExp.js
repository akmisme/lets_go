            Hla Hla’s trip to Ngwesaung was a peaceful escape to the sea. The
            long stretch of white sand and the gentle waves of the Bay of Bengal
            welcomed her with calm and beauty. She enjoyed walking barefoot
            along the shoreline, collecting seashells and watching fishermen
            bring in their daily catch. In the afternoon, she took a boat to
            nearby Lover’s Island, where the view of the ocean was breathtaking.
            As the sun set, the horizon glowed in shades of orange and pink, and
            the sound of the waves made her feel completely at ease. Ngwesaung’s
            quiet charm and natural beauty left Hla Hla with a sense of serenity
            and joy.
