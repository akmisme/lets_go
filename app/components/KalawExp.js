            Hla Hla’s journey to Kalaw was refreshing and full of natural
            beauty. Nestled in the Shan hills, Kalaw welcomed her with cool
            mountain breezes and pine forests that felt far removed from the
            busy cities. She enjoyed wandering through the local market, where
            ethnic groups like the Pa-O and Danu sold fresh produce and handmade
            crafts. The highlight of her trip was trekking through scenic trails
            that led to small villages, where she was greeted with warm smiles
            and traditional tea. Surrounded by rolling hills and vibrant
            greenery, Hla Hla found Kalaw to be a peaceful retreat and a perfect
            gateway to explore the famous Inle Lake.
